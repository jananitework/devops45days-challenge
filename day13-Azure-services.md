# Azure services must to know

1. Azure Virtual Machines (VMs): Azure Virtual Machines provide scalable compute resources similar to Amazon EC2 instances. You can choose from a variety of VM sizes and types to meet your specific requirements.
2. Azure Virtual Network (VNet): Azure Virtual Network allows you to create isolated network environments similar to Amazon VPC. It enables you to define subnets, set up network security groups, and establish connectivity with on-premises networks.
3. Azure Managed Disks: Azure Managed Disks offer durable and scalable block storage for Azure VMs. They function similarly to Amazon EBS and provide persistent storage for your VMs.
4. Azure Blob Storage: Azure Blob Storage is a scalable object storage service that serves as the equivalent of Amazon S3. It enables you to store and retrieve unstructured data such as images, videos, and documents.
5. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD): Azure Active Directory is a comprehensive identity and access management solution equivalent to AWS IAM. It provides authentication and authorization services for Azure resources and integrates with various applications and services.
6. Azure Monitor: Azure Monitor provides monitoring and logging capabilities similar to Amazon CloudWatch. It allows you to collect and analyze performance data, set up alerts, and gain insights into the health and performance of your Azure resources.
7. Azure Functions: Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without managing infrastructure. It is equivalent to AWS Lambda and allows you to build event-driven applications easily.
8. Azure DevOps: Azure DevOps is a suite of development tools and services that includes features similar to AWS CodeBuild. It offers version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and project management capabilities.
9. Azure Resource Manager (ARM): Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service for Azure resources. It is comparable to AWS CloudFormation and allows you to define and deploy infrastructure resources as code.
10. Azure Cost Management and Billing: Azure Cost Management and Billing provides cost tracking and optimization tools similar to AWS Billing and Cost Management. It helps you monitor and manage your Azure spending and provides insights into resource usage and cost allocation.
11. Azure Key Vault: Azure Key Vault is a cloud-based service that helps you safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets. It is equivalent to AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and allows you to manage and control access to encryption keys and other sensitive information.
12. Azure Monitor for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Azure Monitor for AKS provides monitoring and logging capabilities specific to Azure Kubernetes Service. It is similar to AWS CloudTrail and helps you track and analyze activities and events within your AKS clusters.
13. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Azure Kubernetes Service is a managed container orchestration service equivalent to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes.
14. Azure Container Instances (ACI): Azure Container Instances offer a serverless compute environment for running containers without managing the underlying infrastructure. It is similar to AWS Fargate and ECS and provides a convenient way to deploy and manage containers.
15. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): While Azure doesn't provide an exact equivalent to the ELK Stack, it offers various services for log management and analytics. Azure Monitor Logs, Azure Log Analytics, and Azure Monitor Application Insights can be used for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing logs and application telemetry d
